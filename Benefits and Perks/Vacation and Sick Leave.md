# Vacation and Sick Leave

Taking time off and recharging is critical to doing your best work at KitSplit, so in addition to the recognized Holiday List, KitSplit offers 4 weeks (20 days) of paid vacation every year that accrues 1.25 of a day per month of work. Employees should schedule their vacations, let the rest of the team know, and add it to their shared work calendar at least a week in advance.

Employees also accrue 1 hour of sick leave for every 30 hours of work, but cannot accrue more than 5 days of sick leave.

Employees should report vacation and sick days to the founder they report to and also mark it in Justworks. 

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses or other health issues requiring more than 5 days of sick leave should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, disability leave and/or other support.
