# Healthcare and Disability Insurance

KitSplit's priorities with benefits are wellness and education, so itâ€™s important that we offer our staff employees great medical coverage. This is set up through Justworks, which every staff employee should have set up on or before their first day.

We offer medical, dental, and vision coverage for KitSplit employees. 

The medical plan is with Aetna. All employees are eligible for coverage on the first of the month following their hire date. These policies are all managed through Justworks, which is where you can find more details about the plans and their coverage. We cover 70% of the basic Aetna/Justworks plan for employees and 50% coverage for dependents for healthcare, vision, and dental. 

Along with your Aetna plan, there are three "Medical Plus plans" that are included free of cost: HealthAdvocate, One Medical (on-demand primary care), and Teledoc (virtual health). See Justworks for more information on these, and to enroll.
