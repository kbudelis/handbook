## Learning Budget

Every employee has a company budget to support any learning activity that they want to pursue related to the work they do at KitSplit. This doesn’t need to be a class explicitly linked to their current role, but it should help them improve a skill that will be useful for them at KitSplit. Each employee has an annual budget of $500 which can be spent towards program fees/tuition, tickets, flights, and hotels for industry conferences, classes, mentorship programs, books, programs, videos, or other places that they feel will provide valuable learning experiences. These expenses should be discussed in one-on-ones and approved by the founder to whom the employee reports. After an expense is approved, submit an invoice to the founder to whom you report who will then reimbuse you via Justworks. This budget resets at the beginning of every calendar year and does not roll over.  The learning budget is currently limited $500 / year.

## Camera Gear Budget

Every employee has a company budget to support buying camera gear in the form of a one-time reimbursement up to $500. This can be used towards a camera of any kind; lenses; support (tripods, monopods, etc); lighting; VR gear; or audio gear. This expense should be discussed in one-on-ones and approved by the founder to whom the employee reports. After an expense is approved, submit an invoice to the founder to whom you report who will then reimbuse you via Justworks.

## Mentorship

KitSplit understands the value of mentorship.  Let us know if you would like us to work with you to find a mentor in your field outside of the company who you can regularly meet with and get advice. Mentorship goals will be discussed in one-on-ones. Employees are encouraged to meet with mentors in their field during normal work hours.  

## Speaker Support

It makes KitSplit look great when our employees speak at industry conferences, so we love to support KitSplit employees who are invited to speak to their peers about their area of expertise. Employees should get approval from the founder they report to about which conferences are appropriate to speak at, and to make sure that conference dates don’t interfere with important company dates.
