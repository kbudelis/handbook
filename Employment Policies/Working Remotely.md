# Working Remotely

As a small team, things move very quickly and decisions are made or reversed as new information helps guide us. This can make it difficult to keep up with company progress for anyone who isnâ€™t in the office participating in all the conversations that are going on. As a result, for those based in NYC where our main office is, we put a high premium on physical colocation. On occaision, we will hire remote workers. 

Every employee is an important contributor to the decisions we make and the work we do as a team, so we expect full-time NYC-based employees to be at the KitSplit office at least 4 days a week, and to be punctual for team meetings. If employees have a consideration which requires them to be out of the office, they should get approval from the founder they report to as far in advance as possible, and at least a full day before the absence.

KitSplit fulltime employees may choose to work from home 1 days a week (or the equivalent, ie two half days) if it does not otherwise disrupt work (ie missing in-person meetings). If you plan to work from home let everyone know with good lead time what day or half day it will be. 

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, and other support.
