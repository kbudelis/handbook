## Working Remotely ##

# Scope 

This policy addresses full-time employees based in NYC. It does not address part-time employees, some of whom are not based in NYC. Currently, we do not have any full-time workers who are not based in NYC, but if and when the current company setup changes, we will address that situation accordingly. 

# Policy

As a small team, things move very quickly and decisions are made or reversed as new information helps guide us. This can make it difficult to keep up with company progress for those who aren't in the office participating in all the conversations that are going on. As a result, for those based in NYC where our main office is, we put a high premium on physical colocation.

Every employee is an important contributor to the decisions we make and the work we do as a team, so we expect full-time NYC-based employees to be at the KitSplit office at least 3-4 days a week, and to be punctual for team meetings. If employees have a consideration which requires them to be out of the office, they should get approval from the founder they report to as far in advance as possible, and at least a full day before the absence.

KitSplit fulltime employees may choose to work from home 1-2 days a week (or the equivalent, ie two half days) if it does not otherwise disrupt work (ie missing in-person meetings). If you plan to work from home let everyone know with good lead time what day or half day it will be. If an employee needs, or would like to work more than 1-2 days a week remotely (either on a specific week, or as a more regular occurance) they should discuss it with, and get approval from, the founder to whom they report. 

In addition to the 1-2 days/week allowable remote work, you can also work 1 additional week/year remotely, but you must get prior approval from your manager; plan as far in advance as possible (at least 7 days, but preferably more); and update your calendar, and notify the entire team in advance via slack. 

Employees with chronic or terminal illnesses or other personal issues requiring remote work should talk with the founder they report to about their needs for remote work, flexible time, and other support.

# Approach

We treat working remotely as a privilege that comes with both benefits and costs.

The benefits are primarily ones of flexibility: as individuals, when we work remotely we are able to work when we want to and where we want to. This lets us do our best work and contribute to our team in a custom-crafted framework that lets us lead more fulfilling lives. The costs are primarily ones of communication: being out of the office means more base-line work and incidental complexity for all employees. More is required of both the remote employee and the employees in the office to keep in sync, collaborate, and own the work we do in a visible way.

When we work remotely, it's our responsibility to accept the benefits graciously, and go above and beyond to not let the costs affect our work or the work of our teammates. A remote workday:

-is not shorter than a day at the office
-is not less productive
-is not an excuse for missing commitments (be they meetings or deadlines).
-Even when we aren't in the office, our teammates are still counting on us and it is our responsibility to make sure we are exceeding their expectations.

At the same time, it is the responsibility of workers in the office to reasonably accommodate remote workers. This means being willing to schedule meetings in light of timezone differences and to manage expectations around immediate feedback.

The guidelines in this document (and the handbook at large) give us tools to make remote work easier, but tooling is only a small part of the solution. Every employee needs to complement these tools with extra work to make remote work effective for the employee working remotely and the rest of our team.

Always take the following steps to let the team know you're working remotely ahead of time:

-Post in #fulltime 
-Communicate verbally with the people you work closest with, especially your manager 
-Update your calendar to mark which days you are working remotely


# Loss of the privilege

Having the flexibility to work remotely is a privilege. If an employee's unable to uphold the responsibilities that go along with that privilege, their manager should work with them through their 1:1s and dedicated retrospectives to resolve the issue. If the employe cannot resolve the issue, their manager can revoke the privilege.
