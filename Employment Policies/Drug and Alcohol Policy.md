# Drug and Alcohol Policy

Our priority at KitSplit is to create a safe, comfortable, and productive environment for everyone we work with. We realize that drugs and alcohol can contribute to a culture of harassment or one that feels unsafe for some employees, even as it can foster camaraderie and friendship among others. Above all other considerations, our drug and alcohol policy is intended to preempt and avoid harassment and make work at Clef feel safe.  

**It is the responsibility of every employee to ensure that their individual consumption is not making anyone else feel uncomfortable or unsafe.** Employees who violate this policy may face disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Alcohol may occasionally be brought into the office to celebrate an accomplishment, birthday, or other milestone. There may also be events in the office or with partners after work where alcohol is available.

Illegal drugs should not be used, bought, sold, or distributed while at work, either in the office or outside of the office while representing KitSplit.
