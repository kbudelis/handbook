# Interview Process

Every candidate should go through three interviews that help us find the right person for the job.

Before they are interviewed, the candidate should show some relevant work that will help give us an initial screen and something to talk about in the first coffee interview. They should also learn about KitSplit, the position, and our culture so that they can self-screen if it does not seem like a match.  

# Informal/Coffee or call — 30 Minutes

A resume or online profile can tell us a lot about what a candidate has done, but the first thing we need to find out is what they want to do next, and whether that matches what we’re looking for. This interview can happen over the phone, Skype, in the office, or out at a coffee shop.

The idea is to spend 30 minutes getting to know the candidate and letting them ask questions about KitSplit and the position. T It should be pretty transparent if the candidate’s experience or interests are misaligned for the job.

This interview should also focus on selling KitSplit and recruiting promising candidates, as this is their first real contact with KitSplit and their desire to work here will be formed in this meeting.

# Technical Interview — 1 Hour

The technical interview is a chance to dive into the candidate’s ability at the job they’re interviewing for. The lead on this hire should prepare questions which will go into both high level thinking for the position and low level implementation.

Time should be left for questions and answers from both sides. This interview should filter out an additional 50-70% of candidates (of the remaining 20%), and by the end of it, the lead interviewer should have an opinion on whether or not the candidate is the right person for the job.

# Team Fit —  1-4 hours

Finally, the candidate should come in to meet with and talk to the whole team and discuss a real project we are working on. We want to get a sense for how candidates handle something out of their comfort zone, how they ask for help, etc.
