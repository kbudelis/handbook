# Onboarding

This document is about the general priorities and policies for how we as a company bring new employees onto the team. 

We may also create specific onboarding recommendations for different roles in the future.

# Before Arrival

After a candidate accepts an offer to join KitSplit, there are a few things that we can get out of the way before they show up.

1. Employment paperwork  

    1. Signed offer letter

    2. Signed PIIA

2. Creating accounts

    3. Google Apps account

        1. Gmail [NAME@KitSplit.com](mailto:NAME@KitSplit.com)

        2. Google Drive  

    3. Slack

   4. If applicable, intercom

3. Payroll, benefits, etc. set up via Justworks

5. Put 3 events on whole team’s calendar -- NAME’s First Day, Team Lunch to welcome NAME, and Team Celebration of NAME’s First Day.

# The First Day

A new employee’s first day is critical to making them feel welcome at KitSplit. The goals of the first day are to help them get set up, situated, and comfortable with the team. It is the responsibility of the person who led their hiring process to make sure that happens.

* Everyone in the office should know that they are starting, their name, their gender pronouns, and what they’re doing. There is one person in charge of the onboarding process, but it is everyone’s responsibility individually to make the new employee feel welcome.

* The person in charge of onboarding should block out the whole day and plan to spend it with the new employee helping them get set up. In practice, they won’t need the attention for the entire day, but should never be stranded when they do need it.

* The employee should push something public live during their first day. That might be a code commit, a design change, or a tweet depending on their position, but publishing something is important. This ensures that they’re getting set up to contribute and that they don’t feel restricted while they get up to speed.

* The whole team should eat lunch out together, and this should be put on calendars as far in advance as possible so people don’t schedule other meetings.


# The First Week, Month, Beyond

The first week of working at KitSplit should be focused on learning -- learning the company norms, learning how to work with everyone, learning the tools we use, etc. New employees should be contributing a little bit all week, but the expectation is that they ask questions and get set up, not that they immediately assume leadership.

From there, the process should merge towards the normal process. It’s important to set reasonable expectations and be very supportive for as long as it takes for the employee to feel comfortable at KitSplit (this might be a week for some and a month for others).
